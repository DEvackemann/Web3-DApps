### Steps
#### WSL(Window powerShell)
1.Find the Windows PowerShell in your Start menu and run it as the Administrator.

2.WSL is the Windows Subsystem for Linux and it will allow us to run command line commands in Windows. Here’s more info from Microsoft: ​​
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

3.As described in the docs above, we need to paste this command into PowerShell and hit enter:

```
wsl --install
```
4.Once that’s done, you’ll need to restart your computer.

5.Upon restart you will be prompted to setup an ubuntu username and password and then you will have successfully installed WSL. (Keep a note of both of these pieces of information, you’ll need it later on).
Note: when you type your password it will not show up, just make sure you know what you’re typing!

6.To confirm that everything worked correctly, type the following command into PowerShell:
```

wsl --list --verbose
```
7.You should see it output something like this:
